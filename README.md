# Community Calendar

Project to create a central calendar for Tucson events

## What problem does this solve?

Tucson is a very distributed community, as are many American cities. It's hard to know what's going on around town, and even harder to find that information all in one place. In addition, many online community calendars are difficult to search and filter to get to the thing you're interested in.

## Potential way forward

We don't want to create a new calendar. We do want to creatively think about how to aggregate the information from the current calendars. Our initial hypothesis is that something like a curated search that pulls events from a pre-definded list of sites combined with a strong, intuitive filtering user interface might meet this need.
